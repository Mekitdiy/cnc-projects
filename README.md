# Feed Rates and Depts

Those are values we used base for the CNC-3018 base on our reseachs. 

| Material     | Tools              | Feed Rate  | Plunge Rate | Depth  |
|--------------|------------------- |:----------:|------------:|-------:|
| Soft Plywood | 3mm/Endmil/2flutes | 750 mm/min | 250 mm/min  | 0.7mm  |
| Acrylic      | 3mm/Endmil/1flutes | 600 mm/min | 250 mm/min  | 0.5mm  |

# Tools

The freecad tools library in included in this project [here](.resources/freecad_bits_library/bits_library.fctl) as well a the bits configuration themself. So you should be ready to use [freecad path workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Workbench).
